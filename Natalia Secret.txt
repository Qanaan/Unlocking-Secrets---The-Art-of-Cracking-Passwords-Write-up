Natalia Scenario – Workshop Exercise

In this exercise, students are given two resources:

Natalia’s Instagram account – containing publicly available posts and personal details.

A secure login website – where Natalia is assumed to store her “secrets.”

The students will first perform OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) on Natalia’s Instagram to gather clues about her possible username and password.
Once they collect potential information, they will create their own custom username and password lists based on their findings.

Finally, they will use these lists in a dictionary attack against the provided login website using Burp Suite. If successful, they will uncover a hidden flag inside the secure area, simulating a real-world reconnaissance and password-cracking workflow.

🔍 Natalia Challenge – Story & Question

I was walking past Natalia’s room when I saw her quickly close her laptop as soon as I came in. That made me curious. A little later, I noticed her laptop screen again and saw that she was using a website called LockerSecrets — a place where people keep their secrets safe with a username and password.

Now I want to know what Natalia is hiding.

Question:
Use the clues from Natalia’s Instagram posts to guess her username and password. Make your own username and password lists, then use Burp Suite to try a dictionary attack on the LockerSecrets login page:
